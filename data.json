Not spending enough time on one vowel can also change the meaning! Learn how to correct the American English vowel pronunciation errors that native Chinese speakers frequently make. It's not too late to learn! It doesn't matter how old you are. </p><p>  The instructor uses a vowel chart to demonstrate the similarities and differences between all the vowels. Then she presents a different method using a tongue circle chart. Then she describes and shows exactly how to produce each vowel for both methods and puts the vowels in example sentences that use advanced vocabulary from professional settings, such as high tech and business. </p><p>   Quizzes are included to test your understanding of concepts taught. </p><p>  The written lesson can also be downloaded, so you can follow along and takes notes while watching the videos. </p><p>  Repetition audio exercises are included so you can listen download them, listen on the go, and repeat the target words over and over until they become part of your muscle memory! Each time you listen to the sentence, you will notice something different about it and repeat what your hear. Once you've listened and repeated 6-7 times, you'll be quite good at producing the native sounds demanded by that sentence! </p><p>  But don't stop there! Watch and listen again! The information is dense, and you will surely focus on something different on your second watch-thru. Keep practicing!</p><p>   Students are encouraged to ask the instructor questions and even meet with the instructor to check progress. Students can attend a free monthly office hour on Zoom to ask questions and receive live correction. </p><p>  You can learn to speak English more clearly! </p><p>  This class can be taken before or after the course on consonants, or simultaneously. It is recommended to take vowels and consonants before studying the word stress, rhythm courses, or melody courses. </p>",

You can also take quizzes to check your understanding of concepts of machine learning, R and predictive modelling. Each section contains a practice assignment for you to practically implement your learning on machine learning, R and predictive modelling.</p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-</p><p>What is Machine Learning?</p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p>Why use R for Machine Learning?</p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p>What are the major advantages of using R over Python?</p><ul><li><p>As compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available. Although, Python has almost all features that analysts need, R triumphs over Python.</p></li><li><p>R is a function-based language, whereas Python is object-oriented. If you are coming from a purely statistical background and are not looking to take over major software engineering tasks when productizing your models, R is an easier option, than Python.</p></li><li><p>R has more data analysis functionality built-in than Python, whereas Python relies on Packages</p></li><li><p>Python has main packages for data analysis tasks, R has a larger ecosystem of small packages</p></li><li><p>Graphics capabilities are generally considered better in R than in Python</p></li><li><p>R has more statistical support in general than Python</p></li></ul><p>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Welcome to this course, where we delve deep into the intricacies of corporate financial obligations. This comprehensive course introduces you to the world of bonds and notes payable from a corporate perspective, providing you with a clear understanding of the recording and issuance of such liabilities.</p><p>We kick-start our journey by exploring how to record the issuance of bonds, whether they're issued at par value, a discount, or a premium. Discover how present value calculations, often a challenging area for many learners, can be mastered through multiple methods. We'll guide you through calculations using formulas and algebra, present value tables, and the convenient functionalities of Microsoft Excel.</p><p>Our in-depth coverage continues as we explore how to calculate the issue price of bonds and understand why it often differs from the par or face value. We'll also examine the journal entries related to the retirement of a bond, both at its maturity and before.</p><p>Next, we'll delve into the concept of notes payable, including how to record journal entries for installment notes and construct relevant amortization tables.

Intuit, the owner of QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial for each software package. </p><p>This will be a project based course. We will enter transaction in Excel before entering them into the accounting software, QuickBooks desktop and QuickBooks Online. Excel is more transparent, making it easier to understand the process. QuickBooks will then automate the process making it more efficient. </p><p>We will learn how to turn multicurrency on in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop. We will learn which accounts will be affected most by multicurrency transactions, these accounts being cash account types, accounts receivable account types, and accounts payable account types.</p><p>This course will work an example problems related to the sales cycles and the purchases cycle. The sales cycle will focus in on tracking foreign currency receivables. the purchases cycle will focus on foreign currency payables. </p><p>We will also demonstrate transactions related to forward contracts. We will discuss the uses of forward contracts including for speculative purposes and to mitigate risk on foreign currency transactions.</p><p>The multiple currency feature is useful when the company is holding onto cash in a foreign currency, the software helping us to record the home currency equivalent for financial statement presentation. </p><p>Multiple currency functionality is also helpful when we make sales on account, sending an invoice, hoping to get paid in the future, tracking accounting receivable, but expecting to be paid in a foreign currency. The accounts receivable account will need to be valued in the home currency even though we will be paid in a foreign one. </p><p>We have a similar situation when we make purchases on account, promising to pay in a foreign currency at some point in the future. The accounts payable account will need to be valued in the home currency equivalence even though we will be paying in a foreign currency. </p>",
